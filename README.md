*This website is related to Niche product. Here I have used headphones as niche product. 
*Homepage has six different sections. Header(Navbar), Banner, Services, Reviews, Register, Footer.
*I have limited six items in the service section of home, if you click on explore button you will be directed to all services page where more than 10 items are shown with separate image, name, description and price.
*I have used login/register based login system. User has to first login to visit my orders, place order, dashboard.
*In the dashboard I have used nested routing for normal users and admin.
*Admin will have access to make admin, manage orders, add services. Admin can make any user admin, manage orders and add services.
*Both normal users and admin has access to booking list, review and pay Pages.
*Any registered user can put their reviews about service. Those reviews are shown in the home page.
*On the My orders page the logged in user can see only his/her orders. If the user wants he/she can cancel order anytime. A confirmation message will pop up before that.
*I have used sppiners in the private route pages. Which means reloading in those pages won't redirect user to the login page
*Order status is shown in the My orders page, the admin can update the status of a particular order and users can monitor this visiting the My orders page. This website is built with react-bootstrap.
